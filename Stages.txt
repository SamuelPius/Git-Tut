Trying to see the complete stages of file going from untracked to commit
So what i have learnt now is that when you create a new file inside the git initialized folder; the new file is in the untracked area
After using git add command to the new file, we move it to the staging area
Once i have made change to the file after moving it to the staging area, it exists both in the Staging area and the modified area under the Working Area
Here we have two situatins; one being we can either roll back to the previous version of the file which was stage using the git restore command or use the git add command to the file to move it to the staging area too for commiting.
